# Data Visualisation Project

## Overview
This project analyses industry employment trends in Yorkshire and the Humber from 2015 to 2024, focusing on the impacts of COVID-19 and subsequent recovery. A composite visualisation of four charts is used to explore temporal trends, relative changes, recovery trajectories, and sectoral resilience.

## Key Questions
- How did employment levels change across industries during and after COVID-19?
- Which industries experienced the most pronounced disruptions and recoveries?
- How do pre-pandemic employment sizes relate to recovery rates?

## Contents
- **data_visualisation_code.R** – R code used to create all visualisations.
- **bres_yorkshire_industry.xlsx** – Dataset of annual employee counts by industry.
- **Figures/** – Folder containing all generated plots:
  - Line chart (Chart A)
  - Heatmap (Chart B)
  - Small multiples (Chart C)
  - Scatterplot (Chart D)
  - Composite visualisation

## Visualisation Approach
- The composite visualisation integrates four charts to provide a multi-dimensional perspective.
- Charts were designed using the ASSERT framework and Grammar of Graphics principles.
- Accessibility, clarity, and interpretability were prioritised in all visualisations.

## Key Findings
- COVID-19 caused varying employment disruptions across sectors.
- Some industries recovered rapidly while others remained below pre-pandemic levels.
- The composite visualisation provides insight into structural shifts and sectoral resilience.
