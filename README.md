# Yorkshire Employment Data Visualisation

## Project Overview
This project analyses industry employment trends in Yorkshire and the Humber from 2015 to 2024, with a focus on the impact of COVID-19 and the recovery period.  
The work presents a composite visualisation combining four charts to examine time trends, relative change, recovery patterns, and sector resilience.

## Key Questions
- How employment levels changed across industries during and after COVID-19  
- Which industries experienced the largest declines and fastest recovery  
- How pre pandemic employment size relates to recovery speed  

## Repository Contents
- `data_visualisation_code.R`  
  R scripts used to generate all visualisations  

- `bres_yorkshire_industry.xlsx`  
  Dataset containing annual employment counts by industry  

- `Figures/`  
  Folder containing all plots:  
  - Line chart  
  - Heatmap  
  - Small multiples  
  - Scatterplot  
  - Composite visualisation combining all four charts  

## Visualisation Approach
- Combined four chart types into a single composite view to provide multiple analytical perspectives  
- Applied Grammar of Graphics principles and the ASSERT framework  
- Prioritised clarity, consistency, and accessibility  

## Key Findings
- COVID-19 affected industries unevenly across the region  
- Some sectors recovered rapidly, while others stayed below pre pandemic levels  
- The composite view highlights structural change and sector resilience
