# Data Visualisation Project

## Project Overview
This project explores industry employment trends in Yorkshire and the Humber from 2015 to 2024, with a focus on the impacts of COVID-19 and the subsequent recovery. I created a composite visualisation that combines four charts to look at temporal trends, relative changes, recovery trajectories and sectoral resilience.

## Key Questions
- How did employment levels change across industries during and after COVID-19?
- Which industries were most affected and which recovered fastest?
- How do pre-pandemic employment sizes relate to recovery rates?

## Repository Contents
- **data_visualisation_code.R** – R scripts used to generate all visualisations
- **bres_yorkshire_industry.xlsx** – Dataset of annual employment counts by industry
- **Figures/** – Folder containing all plots:
  - Line chart (Chart A)
  - Heatmap (Chart B)
  - Small multiples (Chart C)
  - Scatterplot (Chart D)
  - Composite visualisation combining all four

## Visualisation Approach
- Combined four charts into a single composite visualisation to provide multiple perspectives
- Used ASSERT framework and Grammar of Graphics principles to design clear, interpretable charts
- Focused on accessibility and clarity so insights were easy to understand

## Key Findings
- COVID-19 disrupted employment differently across industries
- Some sectors recovered quickly, while others remained below pre-pandemic levels
- The composite visualisation highlights structural shifts and sectoral resilience
