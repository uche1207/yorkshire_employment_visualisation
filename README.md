\# Data Visualisation Project


\## Overview

This project analyses industry employment trends in Yorkshire and the Humber from 2015 to 2024, focusing on the impacts of COVID-19 and subsequent recovery. The analysis uses a composite visualisation of four charts to explore temporal trends, relative changes, recovery trajectories, and sectoral resilience.



\## Key Questions

\- How did employment levels change across industries during and after COVID-19?

\- Which industries experienced the most pronounced disruptions and recoveries?

\- How do pre-pandemic employment sizes relate to recovery rates?



\## Contents

\- \*\*data\_visualisation\_code.R\*\*: R code used to create all visualisations.

\- \*\*bres\_yorkshire\_industry.xlsx\*\*: Dataset of annual employee counts by industry.

\- \*\*Figures/\*\*: Folder containing all generated plots:

&nbsp; - Line chart (Chart A)

&nbsp; - Heatmap (Chart B)

&nbsp; - Small multiples (Chart C)

&nbsp; - Scatterplot (Chart D)

&nbsp; - Composite visualisation



\## Visualisation Approach

\- Composite visualisation integrates four charts for a multi-dimensional perspective.

\- Charts are designed using the ASSERT framework and Grammar of Graphics principles.

\- Accessibility, clarity, and interpretability are prioritised in all visualisations.



\## Key Findings

\- COVID-19 caused varying employment disruptions across sectors.

\- Some industries recovered rapidly while others remained below pre-pandemic levels.

\- The composite visualisation provides insight into structural shifts and sectoral resilience.
